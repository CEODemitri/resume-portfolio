# 👋Danke!
Thank you for visiting my portfolio web application. As it is always a work in progress, I feel I should add a under construction banner as a header. The Journey is perpetual learning new skills, adapting and adding/subtracting~(sometimes multiplying and dividing🤣)~ here and there as the times evolve.

## Start
I started this project a few months ago to learn more of Nextjs and Sanity CMS. FreeCodeCamp released a YouTube video at the beginning of my research and I thought, "Right on Time." So I followed along Building the project whule learning from an Expert on proper techniques and methodologies. Very Insightful tutorial: I continued to build on to the project to add my own flavor. I believe this was the perfect practice at working on an existing codebase and pushing my own ideas to the project🎯. 

## Goal
Create a Site that Projects who I am as a Valuable Asset. 
There exists many sites, many working forms of media. What may I add to this abyss?

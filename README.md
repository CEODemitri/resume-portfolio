# 👋Danke!
Thank you for visiting my portfolio web application. As it is always a work in progress, I feel I should add a under construction banner as a header. The Journey is perpetual learning new skills, adapting and adding/subtracting~(sometimes multiplying and dividing🤣)~ here and there as the times evolve.

## New Effect
This project was once my own Portfolio Site, only completed after about 2 weeks or 2 months from following a Tutorial by FreeCodeaCamp and Sanity. Very cool project and I learned a lot of cool concepts and techniques. However much I am in love with Project and despite the many days of adapting the project to speak for me, I find it hard to call my own. 
So, This will become a playground/project to practice and explore.
